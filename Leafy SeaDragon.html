<h2>Discription</h2>
<p>Much like the <a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse">SeaHorse</a>, the leafy seadragon's name is derived from its resemblance to another creature (in this case, the mythical dragon). While not large, they are slightly larger than most seahorse, growing to about 20-24 (8â€“9.5 in). They feed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton">plankton</a> and small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean">crustaceans</a>.</p>
