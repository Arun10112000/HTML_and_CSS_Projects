        <li>When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur.</li>
        <li>The server might return an error code like "404 Not Found".</li>
        <li> It is common to name these errors <a class="a1" href="www.w3schools.com/html">Html </a>error messages.</li>
        <li>But these messages are something called <a class="a1" href="www.w3schools.com/http">HTTP</a> status messages.</li>
        <li> In fact, the server always returns a message for every request. </li>
        <li> The most common message is 200 OK.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML Styles - CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
                With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
                Using CSS
                CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
                <ul id="list">
                <li><b>Inline </b>- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
                <li> <b>Internal</b> - by using a style element in the head section</li>
               <li><b>External</b> - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
            </ul>
           
            </p>
