    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p class="p2">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a <span class="span">Web browser</span>. It defines the meaning and structure of <span class="span4">web content</span>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <span class="span5">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> and scripting languages such as <span class="span6">JavaScript</span>.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive <span class="span3">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
