    <h1 id="h1">What is Coloring?</h1>
    <p>The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.</p>

    <p>CSS provides several methods of directly specifying an sRGB color: hex colors, rgb()/rgba() color functions, hsl()/hsla() color functions, hwb() color function, named colors, and the transparent keyword.</p>

It is basically a technique of evaluation by comparing a sample with a standard color. The analysis is used in a variety of industries to test the quality of the products, processes, and raw materials.</p>
